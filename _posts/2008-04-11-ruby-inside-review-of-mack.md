As you may, or may not not, I'm a big fan of Ruby Inside. It's one of my favorite Ruby based blogs on the web. Peter Cooper does a great job with this site, and has recently started the RubyFlow.com website, which is a bit more of a 'firehouse of Ruby' type site.Â 

Anyway, today Peter gave a very favorable review of Mack. I would definitely encourage you to head on over and have a read of it.

Thanks Peter.
