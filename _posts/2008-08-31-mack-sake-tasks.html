Thanks to Mack user,Â DeLynn Berry, for writing up some great Sake tasks! Now getting up and running with Mack development is even easier. Thanks DeLynn!

All you need to do is install <a href="http://errtheblog.com/posts/60-sake-bomb" target="_blank">Sake</a>.

Once Sake is installed you can install the Mack sake tasks like so:
<pre>sake -i http://www.mackframework.com/mack-dev.sake</pre>
You can see a full list of tasks with the following command:
<pre>sake -T</pre>
