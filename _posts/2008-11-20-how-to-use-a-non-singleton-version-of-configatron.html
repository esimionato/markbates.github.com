Since Configatron has come out it's become a pretty popular library, and because of that I've received several feature requests. Nothing wrong with that. I actually welcome that, because, let's be honest, that's how configatron will become even better.

The biggest request I've received is from people who want to use Configatron, but they want their own instance of it, and not the global singleton instance of it. Although, I personally don't see why you would need that, I'm a big enough man to understand that just because I don't need it, doesn't mean others don't.

Last night I was reviewing the code, because I was asked this question again, and in doing so I realized that power has been there all along. It's actually very simple. When you make a call on <code>Kernel#configatron</code> it returns a singleton of the <code>Configatron</code> class, but after that all it does is return an instance of the <code>Configatron::Store</code> class. So if you want your own instance of Configatron, what you really want is an instance of the <code>Configatron::Store</code> class, which you can do like so:

Well, there you go, I hope that helps. Enjoy.
