I'm sure everyone is wondering why things have been so quiet around the Mack front recently. Well, there are a couple of reasons. One, I'm on vacation in Ireland right now, so my coding time has dropped dramatically. Second, I'm still very much so patiently awaiting the 0.9.2 release of DataMapper, which the next version of Mack needs. Third, there is a lot of Mack work afoot at the moment.

The company I work has seen fit to give me a few more resources to help me make Mack the most kick ass framework out there. I've not got 1.5 more bodies diligently working away on Mack, with another body to hopefully be hired in the next full weeks. That will mean, within a few weeks there will be 3.5 full time bodies working on Mack! Awesome!

There are some great things that are going to be in the next build, but mostly it'll be a nice refactoring. We're going to splitting a bunch of stuff out of the core of Mack and putting into a mack-more package, similar to the approach Merb and DataMapper have adopted. In mack-more there will be l10n internationalization, RJS support (Prototype AND jQuery), DataMapper 0.9.x support, HAML, Markaby, PDF::Writer support, amongst others. It'll be nice. Trust me. :)

We hope to have the next release out within the first or second week of July, of course, this really depends on when the DataMapper release can get out there. Once we get this release out, we can really focus on some extremely kick ass new features. Stay tuned!
