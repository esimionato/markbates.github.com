So after trying to use Trac for a few weeks now, I've decided that right now it's just slowing me down. Particularly when dealing with roadmaps, etc... So for now, if you find bugs, want to contribute, or you just have questions, simply visit the contribute page on this site and send me an email.

As things progress and there are more contributors, and more people using Mack, this may all change. Until then...
