At RubyConf a bunch of us sat around a few glasses of beer and had a 'bitch' session about the state of Ruby Gems, a system we all consider be rather sub-par. At that session Tracy Flynn, friend andÂ colleague of yours truly, said we should do something about it. He suggested we write RubyOpals. Well, Tracy is putting his money where his mouth is,Â <a href="http://github.com/tflynn/rubyopals/tree/master" target="_blank">http://github.com/tflynn/rubyopals/tree/master</a>. I can tell you that I for one, can't wait for Ruby Opals! I've already forked the project and started contributing! As soon as the first version is ready for release, I can tell you that Mack, Cachetastic, Genosaurus, etc... will all be the first available as opals.

I highly encourage all of you out there to add this project to your 'watch' list on GitHub. And if you have the time, and want to help write something special, I highly encourage you to fork it and start contributing! Time to get out there and start making the Ruby world a much, much, much better place.
