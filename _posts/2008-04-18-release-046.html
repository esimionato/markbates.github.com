This is a pretty cool release. First off Thin has been updated to 0.8.0, a rather nice, stable release. ERB has been replaced with <a href="http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/" target="_blank">Erubis</a>Â to give a significant improvement in speed, which, after all is one of Mack's most important traits.Â 

There's been a general overhaul of the generators included with Mack. Mostly, cleaning them up. With that said things like the scaffold, model, and migration generators have been updated to do what a lot of people have been asking for, that is take a 'cols' parameter and build out the generated code corrrectly. This really makes life, very, very simple.

There will be a re-written 'blog' tutorial coming out soon to make use of this, as well as migration support that's now part of Mack.

Very exciting stuff! Enjoy!

Changelog:
<ul>
	<li>Mack now uses Erubis, http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/, for it's rendering engine instead of ERB. This makes Mack even faster now! Yippie!</li>

	<li>Updated rake generate:migration name=&lt;model_name&gt; (optional: cols=&lt;col_1&gt;:&lt;col_1_type&gt;,&lt;col_2&gt;:&lt;col_2_type&gt;) This will create the proper table migration for you.</li>
	<li>Updated rake generate:scaffold to use the ModelGenerator now.</li>
