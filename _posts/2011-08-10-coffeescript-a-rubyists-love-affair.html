Last night I had the pleasure of presenting to the <a href="http://www.bostonrb.org">Boston Ruby User's Group</a> on CoffeeScript. My talk was geared to helping Rubyists understand, and hopefully love, CoffeeScript. Along the way I tried to debunk a few myths and preconceptions as to what CoffeeScript is and isn't. The reaction was really positive, so hopefully I did my job. Anyway, here are the slides:
