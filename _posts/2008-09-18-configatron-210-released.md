On the heels of yesterday's release of Configatron 2.0.0, Cody Maggard has generously donated a patch to add the following methods: <code>unprotect</code>, <code>protect_all!</code>, and <code>unprotect_all!</code>

Cody is also the developer of the configatron-rails plugin which makes integrating configatron into your Rails app pretty darn easy. You can checkout his project on <a href="http://github.com/cmaggard/configatron-rails/tree/master" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Thanks Cody!
