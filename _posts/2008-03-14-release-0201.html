As previously mentioned there was an issue in a Mack dependency, cachetastic. Mack 0.2.0 used cachetastic-1.3.1 which had a require for the memcache-client gem.

If you didn't have the gem installed you would get some not very nice messages. This require was fixed in cachetastic-1.4.1. Mack 0.2.0.1 uses the new version of cachetastic. There is no new functionality in 0.2.0.1, it's simply the require fix.

Some really cool functionality is in the works for 0.3.0 of Mack, including everyone's favorite, distributed routes. This, unfortunately, probably won't be out till the end of next week.
<pre>$ sudo gem install mack</pre>
Like always, please allow time for the gem to propagate throughout the RubyForge mirrors.
