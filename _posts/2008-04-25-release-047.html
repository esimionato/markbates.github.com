0.4.7 is a MUST have release. It fixes a few good bugs, like the ability to upload files now works! Plus it introduces a few nice little goodies.

File uploads are now pretty easy to do. There's a new Mack::Request::UploadedFile that helps to wrap the Hash that Rack gives you when you upload a file. Here's a simple example of it being used:
<pre>class UploadsController &lt; Mack::Controller::Base
Â  def create
Â    @my_new_file = request.file(:my_new_file)
Â    @my_new_file.save_to([MACK_PUBLIC, "uploaded_files", @my_new_file.file_name])
Â  end
end</pre>
That's it! That's all you need to upload a file! I'm going to add file uploads to the blog demo over the next few days.

You can now do 'namespaced' routes, such as Admin::UserController. You can very simply map them in your routes.rb as:
<pre>r.resource "admin/users"</pre>
There's now a new rake task, generator:list, that shows all the generators available to your app.

Darsono Sutedja gets the prize for being the first person, other than myself, to contribute to Mack. Thanks a ton Darsono! It's much appreciated.

All of the generators now use the Genosaurus generator system. Not really that exciting, but it makes for a nice, cleaner code base.

There's a few other things in there as well. The changelog below has a few more things. Enjoy!
