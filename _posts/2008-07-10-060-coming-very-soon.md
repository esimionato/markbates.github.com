Well folks, as you know, things have been a bit quiet on the Mack front these days, but it's all been for a very good reason. We've been prepping the next release, 0.6.0. This release is expected to hit the streets sometime the beginning of next week. There's a lot of really great stuff in the release, DataMapper 0.9.2 support (finally!), RSpec testing support, a mack-more project to house a bunch of cool Mack related gems, Exception handling in Routing, and more... A full list will be available when the release happens.

In addition to the great new features, a lot of bugs have been worked out, and more of the API has solidified further. Because of some of these changes I've posted an upgrade guide from 0.5.x to 0.6.0. This guide can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.mackframework.com/index.php/en/Upgrading%20from%200.5.x%20to%200.6.x" target="_blank">wiki</a>.&nbsp;

This guide is meant to make upgrading as quickly and as a painless possible. There are a couple of big changes, but they should be fairly simple to make.

I'm very happy with this release, it's been long toiled over, and it shows. It's very stable, fast, and fun. I think everyone is really going to like it.&nbsp;

As more info about the release becomes available, I'll keep everyone posted.
