I know with each release I say how excited I am by this release, but that's usually because with each release there's some great new feature that makes me either proud to have developed it, or to proud to be associated with it. Mack 0.8.1 is definitely no exception.

Before I get into what has to be my favorite feature since the distributed features of 0.7.0, and quite possibly my favorite feature in Mack today, let's talk about a few of the other features in this release.
<h3>More Routing Enhancements</h3>
There are a few great new features in the routing system in this release. The first off is a real crowd favorite, Nested Resources. Just like Rails you can now nest resources in Mack.

In Mack 0.8.0 we introduced the ability to put host information in the routes file. This would be used to match the host when matching a route as well as building the url for that route when using the url helpers. This made dealing with subdomains very easier. Well, to really give everyone that subdomain fu everybody loves, we've added the ability to put embedded parameters in the host parameter in routes. It's pretty dang cool, let me tell you. Checkout these examples:

<h3>Pagination API</h3>
There is now a pagination API that's part of the mack-orm API. The first implementation of this in the mack-data_mapper package. At its heart it's extremely easily to implement for new ORMs, one method, and using it is just as easy. There will be a write up on using the API in the forth coming days.
<h3>Jabber Support</h3>
The mack-notifier package can now send notifications using the Jabber protocol.
<h2>!!Portlets!!</h2>
Portlets are what components in Rails should've been and they're what slices in Merb should be. Portlets are a way off packaging a full Mack application into a Ruby Gem so they can easily be shared and used in other Mack applications. As you're about to see, this simple page is all the information you need to know about developing, testing, packaging, and using Portlets.

Portlets encapsulate a whole Mack application, from controllers to views to models to configuration settings to your images, stylesheets and javascripts. This makes it possible to develop extremely rich applications and share them with other Mack applications.
