It dawned on me today as I released 0.4.1 that's it has been one month since the first release, 0.0.4. What a month it's been! When 0.0.4 got released I hadn't been working on Mack for more than a few weeks. So really, Mack has been going for about six weeks now. It's funny to think how far the code has progressed, how many features have been developed, and most importantly, how much attention it's received.

Firsts:
<ul>
	<li>First Bug: Matt Todd found the first bug with a Mack. It was a simple bug with convert_security_of_methods the second parameter wasn't being used. Matt has since become a good friend of Mack, and has a couple of other firsts on this list.</li>
	<li>First Blog Comment: Mr. Eel questioning the validatey of some rough DataMapper vs. ActiveRecord numbers I posted.</li>
	<li>First Link to Mack: Matt Todd gets his second 'first' of this list.</li>
	<li>First 'Demo' Request: Gregg Pollack from <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com" target="_blank">RailsEnvy.com</a> requested a demo app so he could feature Mack on the RailsEnvy.com podcast.</li>
	<li>First Podcast: I think this one is fairly obvious, but it goes to the <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com" target="_blank">RailsEnvy.com </a>guys. Thanks for the press!</li>
	<li>First Speaking Request: Tom Dyer/Boston Ruby Users Group. I'll be speaking May 13th on the joys of Mack.</li>
	<li>First Request to Contribute: Arun Agrawal.</li>
	<li>First Tech Support Request: Brian Dunbar. He had some trouble running the demo app. Turns out it was a bad require in the cachetastic gem, that I subsequently fixed.</li>
	<li>First 'Watcher' on GitHub.com: Once again, Mr. Matt Todd! Gotta love the Matt.</li>
	<li>First Fork on GitHub.com:          <span id="profile_name" rel="/users/kabari">Kabari Hendrick. Based out of Chicago, <a href="http://www.threedozen.com/" target="_blank">http://www.threedozen.com/</a>, I'm excited to see what he does with his fork.</span></li>
</ul>
Wow! That's a lot of firsts for a first month. Here's a list of some of the features that have been released in that time:
<ul>
	<li>Distributed Routes!</li>
	<li>Better testing support</li>
	<li>Built-in encryption/decryption</li>
	<li>XML support</li>
	<li>A Generator framework</li>
	<li>'Scaffold' generator</li>
	<li>Plugin support</li>
	<li>Server-side redirects</li>
	<li>Inflection</li>
	<li>Render url</li>
	<li>Extensible rendering system</li>
	<li>'Format' driven content</li>
</ul>
That's just a few things that have gone in there. That's not to mention refactoring, documentation, demo apps, etc...

I'd like to this time to say thank you to everyone on the 'firsts' lists. I would like to thank everyone else who's shown interest, commented, wrote about, or even just thought of Mack. Every comment on the site, every email I get, every blog link I see fills me with great happiness and makes me think that I'm on to something here.

I truly feel that there is a void for a Ruby web framework that deals with distributed, portal-like applications, and that's where Mack is headed. That's what makes Mack different from Rails or Merb or Ramaze or Sinatra or any other framework out there.

What's on the horizon for Mack? A lot. I'm going to be speaking at the Boston Ruby Users Group on May 13th. Of course, I'll be showing off Mack, so if you're in town, I would recommend coming on down. Details on that as we get closer to the event. You can expect more app to app communication, more generators, more ORM support, more testing support, page caching, 'portlets', and much much more!

Once again, thanks to everyone for their support. I'm looking forward to see what the future holds.
