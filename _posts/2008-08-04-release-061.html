Mack 0.6.1.1 features 38 completed tickets and a whole host of really great features and improvements. Here's a quick overview of a few of the big features in Mack 0.6.1.1.
<h3>Page Caching</h3>
There is now a mack-caching gem which gives you easy to use page caching when you require it. To use page caching first you need to add it to your gems.rb file like such:
<pre>gem.add "mack-caching", :libs =&gt; "mack-caching"</pre>
That will require the gem and give your app access to the page caching libraries. Next you to turn on page caching in your application. In the appropriate config/*.yml file add the following:
<pre>use_page_caching: true</pre>
Now, you just need to tell your controllers which actions they should cache:
<pre>class FooController
&nbsp;&nbsp;include Mack::Controller
&nbsp;&nbsp;cache_pages :only =&gt; [:index, :show]
end</pre>
If you give the cache_pages no optional parameters then it will cache all the actions for that controller. Alternatively, you could give it an :except parameter to list the actions you don't want cached.&nbsp;
<h3>Notifiers (aka Mailers)</h3>
Mack now has a mack-notifier gem that will be the repository for all 'notification' systems, the first of which is email. The Mack::Notifier API is simple and easy to use and will allow developers to plugin in different notification systems under the cover without having to change their application code.&nbsp;

A notifier can look as simple as:
<pre>class WelcomeEmail
&nbsp;&nbsp;include Mack::Notifier
end</pre>
With that you can then write the following bit of code:
<pre>we = WelcomeEmail.new
we.to = "foo@example.com"
we.from = "bar@example.com"
we.subject = "Hello World"
we.body(:text) = "My plain text body"
we.body(:html) = "My html body"
we.attach(Mack::Notifier::Attachment.new("/path/to/my/file"))&nbsp;
we.deliver</pre>
Obviously there's a lot more to the API, including a validations module, but that's a subject for another post.&nbsp;
<h3>JavaScript (aka RJS)</h3>
The mack-javascript gem now gives you Rails-like RJS support for Mack. The default library to use with mack-javascript is jQuery, but there is prototype support available as well.&nbsp;
<h3>Data Factory</h3>
Creating faux data for testing can be a real nightmare. Fixtures can be difficult to maintain and trying to create your own faux data can be a chore. That's where the mack-data_factory gem comes in.

For each model that you want to produce, you will need to define a factory class. &nbsp;

Let's say that I have 2 models: Item and User, and Item belongs to user. &nbsp;So the factories will look like the following:
<pre>class ItemFactory
&nbsp;&nbsp;include Mack::Data::Factory
&nbsp;&nbsp;field :title, "MyItem"
&nbsp;&nbsp;field :owner_id, {:user =&gt; 'id'}
end

class UserFactory
&nbsp;&nbsp;include Mack::Data::Factory
&nbsp;&nbsp;field :username, "planters", :length =&gt; 25, :content =&gt; :alpha
&nbsp;&nbsp;field :password, "roastedPeanuts", :immutable =&gt; true
end</pre>
So, the 2 classes above defined the factory for item and user. &nbsp;As you can see, each factory will need to explicitly&nbsp;list all the fields that it will populate, and for each field, you can define rules on how the content is generated.

Supported content types:&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>:alpha --&gt; alphabets. &nbsp;rules: [:length, :min_length, :max_length]</li>
	<li>:alphanumeric --&gt; alphabets and number. &nbsp;rules: same as :alpha</li>
	<li>:numeric --&gt; numbers [optional, because if the field's default value is number, its content type will automatically set to numeric)</li>
	<li>:email --&gt; generate random email address</li>
	<li>:username --&gt; generate random username</li>
	<li>:domain --&gt; generate random domain name</li>
	<li>:firstname --&gt; generate first name</li>
	<li>:lastname --&gt; generate last name</li>
	<li>:name --&gt; generate full name</li>
	<li>:city --&gt; generate city name</li>
	<li>:streetname --&gt; generate street name</li>
	<li>:state --&gt; generate state. &nbsp;rules: [:country --&gt; :us or :uk, :abbr --&gt; true if you want a abbreviated state name (us only)]</li>
	<li>:zipcode --&gt; generate zipcode. rules: [:country --&gt; :us or :uk]</li>
	<li>:phone --&gt; generate phone number</li>
	<li>:company --&gt; generate company name. &nbsp;rules: [:include_bs --&gt; include sales tag line]
example: &nbsp;field, "", :content =&gt; :company, :include_bs =&gt; true&nbsp;could generate something like:
Fadel-Larkin&nbsp;monetize cross-media experiences</li>
</ul>
<div>There's a lot more to the mack-data_factory gem, so I highly recommend you check it out.</div>
