Although not as sexy a release as 0.7.0, there are some very important bug fixes and some cool new little features in this release. Rack has been upgraded to v0.4.0. DataMapper to 0.9.5. Facets to 2.4.4, and a few other gems as well.

There is now a much nicer session store API that will allow developers to build their own session stores. There's also a couple of new session stores that ship with 0.7.1. There's a DataMapper session store, and a cookie session store, which is now the default session store. The previous Cachetastic based session store can be used by requiring the mack-caching gem in gems.rb and putting the following setting in your app_config/*.yml file:
<pre>mack::session_store: cachetastic</pre>
There is now built-in support to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks on forms.&nbsp;Some view helper methods have nice updates such as :disable_with and :confirm, and asset hosts.

And a whole host of other little improvements across the board. Enjoy!
