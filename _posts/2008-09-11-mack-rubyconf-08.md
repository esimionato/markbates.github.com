Mark your calendars, on Day One, from 1.15PM - 2.00PM, in Room 2, I'll be delivering a presentation on building distributed applications.

<a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/talks/15" target="_blank">http://www.rubyconf.org/talks/15</a>
<blockquote>Building multiple applications that all need to share data and other information between can be a&nbsp;daunting and challenging task. Mark will help to demystify the use of Ruby systems such as Rinda and&nbsp;DRb and show you how they can be used to link applications together. Through the development of the&nbsp;Mack framework and its use in building Helium.com, Mark will share the highlights and the pitfalls&nbsp;of distributed application development.</blockquote>

Make sure and sign up for the conference today, as attendance is limited to only 500.
