For those of you who haven't yet switched to Mack (and why not?) the new <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr/advanced-rails-recipes" target="_blank">Advanced Rails Recipes</a> book is now shipping from the Pragmatic Programmers. The book features 84 recipes for build apps using Ruby on Rails. It just so happens that two of these recipes happen to be written by yours truly. That's right, I'm now a published author. :)Â 

I suggest that everyone get yourself a copy of the book, read it top to bottom, then head on over to GitHub and incorporate some of what you've just learned into Mack.

Anyway, I just want to give a quick shout out to my boy Mike Clark who compiled and edited the book. He's a great guy and he did a great job. Thanks Mike!
