If you haven't noticed by now, I tend to release smaller releases more often. I know there isn't much precedent for that as Mack has only been out a week, and there's only been three releases, but I can assure you, it's a sign of things to come.

I feel that at this stage in a code's life cycle, it benefits from getting out into the wild sooner, rather then later. Sure, I could bulk up features and bug fixes and do big 'wow' factor releases, but why should I sit on a cool feature or an important bug fix simply so I can have a bit of 'wow'? Why not let people start to enjoy those new features, and give me important feedback earlier?

I'm sure as the code tree grows and people start really using Mack, things may slow down a bit. When there are more developers then just myself, things will definitely slow down a pace, but until then, I just don't see the point in holding back.

When I have something cool and ready to go, I'm going to release it. You don't <em>have</em> to upgrade your Mack environment if you don't want to, you can if you want. If you would prefer to 'bulk' them up yourself, then that's entirely up to you. Like I've said before, Mack is trying to be as non-opinionated as it can be. That includes how you update your system.

Anyway, I just thought I would share a bit of how things will be handled going forward. I hope that's fine with you.

Have a good weekend.
