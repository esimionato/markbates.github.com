It's finally here! The release you've all been waiting for, 0.4.0!! What's new in this one? Well, the big one, <strong>DISTRIBUTED ROUTING</strong>!!! Now you can share your routes between all of your Mack applications.

I'm very excited about this release. This is one of the first features that starts to set Mack apart from other Ruby frameworks such as Rails and Merb.Â  Mack is trying to set itself as the framework for doing multiple, distributed, portal applications. This release gets us headed in that direction.

There will be a tutorial post and app in the next few days. In the meantime I highly encourage you to download this release and check it out.
