So about 2 minutes after my post earlier about DataMapper a video was posted by one of the developers:
<div>

<a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf2008.confreaks.com/04katz.html" target="_blank">http://mtnwestrubyconf2008.confreaks.com/04katz.html</a>

I watched the video, start to finish, and I do believe I'm starting to come around to the idea of DataMapper. I even understand why they do the 'properties' in the model. Once you understand that DataMapper is meant to be used with an persistent back end, not just a database, that starts to make more sense.

The concepts, and the ideas, behind what they're trying to do is really good, and I love some of the features that are hidden behind an almost ActiveRecord like syntax.

With that said, I still don't understand why I'm getting the performance numbers that I'm getting. It just doesn't seem to right to me. I feel as though I'm missing some fundamental.

So, again, I throw the challenge out there to people to help me figure out why I'm not seeing great numbers when it comes to DataMapper.

In the meantime, I'm going to start to really get to know it's API, because I think it has a lot of potential.
