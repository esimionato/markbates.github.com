There is now a Trac system set up to help deal with bug/feature tickets, wiki, roadmap, etc... You can find it at <a href="http://trac.mackframework.com">http://trac.mackframework.com</a>.

While you're there you can browse the new SVN repository, see what code is in the pipelines, etc...

It's all very exciting, in a really geeky sort of way.
