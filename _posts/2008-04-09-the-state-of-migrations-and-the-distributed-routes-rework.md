I was really hoping to get the rewrite of distributed routes using Rinda, as well as migration support for both ActiveRecord and DataMapper out either today, or by the end of the week. As it turns out, because of the Class bug in DataMapper 0.3.0 it doesn't look like that's going to happen till early next week. Sorry about that folks. I've lost a lot of time on the DataMapper thing, but I've got a work around, locally anyway, that is allowing me to keep developing. As soon as I get it all done, I'll be very happy to release it all. Stay tuned.
