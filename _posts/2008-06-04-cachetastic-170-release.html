The simple, yet extremely powerful, Ruby caching framework, Cachetastic has been upgraded to 1.7.0. The big new feature of this release is the Cachetastic::Cacheable module. Including this module allows any class to become a Cache.
<pre>class Person
include Cachetastic::Cacheable
end
Person.set_into_cache(:hi, "Hello There")
Person.get_from_cache(:hi) #=&gt; "Hello There"</pre>
Under the covers this creates a Cachetastic::Caches::Base object and proxies requests to it. This is a very simple example and belies the richness of the Cachetastic library.Â

Features:
<ul>
	<li>Flexible configuration. All caches have can either have their own configurations, or they can inherit from a default configuration.</li>
	<li>Easy to use Adapter API. Included adapters include, LocalMemory, Memcache, DRb, File, and more. With the Adapter API being so simple, it's easy to build your own custom adapter.</li>
	<li>Flexible logging. Each cache can have it's own loggers, or they can use the default logger.</li>
	<li>JIT caching. Through Ruby's powerful block structure, you can pass a block to a 'get' call and have it run if the results from the get are either 'nil' or 'empty'</li>
	<li>Cachetastic::Cacheable module turns any Object into a cache. It allows for any instance of that Object to cache and uncache itself.</li>
	<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
