On Monday, August 25th, Mack 0.7.0 will be released. This is an extremely important release for Mack. Why is that you ask? Good question. Well, this is release that finally brings the much talked about distributed feature set to Mack. Distributed routes have been around for quite some time, but distributed views/layouts and distributed objects (models) have been missing. Well, in less than a week, you'll have them!

Now I know that you're just as excited about what's coming as I am, that's why I've prepared the first ever Mack screencast to demostrate these features. The screencast is a little rough around the edges, but it gets the ideas across.Â 

As always I'll post more about the 0.7.0 as the release date nears. In the meantime enjoy the screencast:
