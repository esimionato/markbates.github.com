<img class="alignleft" title="biz plan" src="http://www.honeytechblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/business-plan.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="224" />Recently I was fortunate enough to be down in New Orleans for <a href="http://launchpadignition.com/launchfest" target="_blank">Launchfest</a> to help launch one of my clients, <a href="http://liveset.com" target="_blank">Liveset.com</a>. The launch was very successful and I was pleased to be a part of it. Apart from helping to launch Liveset I also had the opportunity to chat with a lot of new entrepreneurs. These conversations led me to think about how technology companies are launched, and how I, as a consultant, can help launch those companies.

Let's start at the beginning, the idea. You're an entrepreneur with a great new idea for a technology based company. Where do you start? What do you do? Well, you need two things; 1.) Money 2.) Your product. While I can't help you get money, I can help you build your product. So let's talk about that.

My advice to everybody who wants to start a technology based company is to keep your development in house. Don't outsource it. You want to be in control of your most valuable asset. You don't want somebody else, some other company, managing that asset for you. You want your own development team, in house, building that technology for you.

So how do you go about building that team with a very limited budget and no time to get started? Well, I would propose you don't. Hire a consultant. Confused yet? I just told you to do it all in house and then I turned around and said hire a consultant.

What's the difference between hiring a development shop (or outsourcing) or hiring a consultant such as myself. Well, a big development shop can offer you a nice one stop shop for development. They have several developers ready to build your application. They have designers ready to go. They have processes in place to manage the relationship and speed it along. And that's because they're interest is in building your app and moving on to the next customer. That's what they do. That means you have to bend to their way of working, pay their very high costs, use they're software, and can generally be quite restrained in terms of changing your product or direction.

As a consultant I take a very different approach to building your company. The first major difference was in that last statement. I want to build your company, not just your technology. I come into a new project as if I was employee #1. I will work with you on all fronts to make sure when you launch it's the company you want, and not the application some other company wanted to build for you.

It's important to make sure that whomever you're working with challenges your assumptions. Questions the decisions you make, obviously within reason. Offers you valuable insight into how technology should be built, used, and deployed. That's part of a what a consultant can do for you. Your needs will change constantly during the launch of your company and you to make sure that whoever is working with you can react to those changes. The consultant should help you set up your workflow, tools, and processes for going forward. In short they should help you set up your company.

Once your product is built and launched the consultant can then help you find and hire that all important first employee. They will help onboard that employee and hand off the development of  your technology to your new in house team.

So, the next time you have the big idea, you get your first round of angel funding, and are trying to figure out to build your product, think carefully about the route you take to get there. Hire a big development shop to quickly bang out a product for you (knowing that it might not actually be the product you want) or hire a consultant who will act as a fellow team member and help build both your company as well as your product.
