About.com became the first, that I know about, to review my book, "Distributed Programming with Ruby". What a great first review to have as well. They rated the book 5 out of 5 stars! The review can be found <a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/bookreviews/gr/distributedprogramming.htm">here</a>.
<blockquote>"Anyone working with distributed programming in Ruby will want this book."</blockquote>
The only downside they saw in the book, was that they wanted it to be longer! I have to save something for the 2nd edition, don't I? :)

If you haven't purchased yours yet, I encourage you to do so. It's on sale at <a href="http://book.markbates.com">Amazon.com</a> right now.

If you have reviewed the book, or know of a review of the book, please pass it along.
