So yesterday I committed a Mack adapter to <a href="http://github.com/macournoyer/thin/commit/ce6d00751644715c82044d1194a34fc61ca0823d" target="_blank">Thin</a>. What does this mean? It means that in the next release of Thin there will native support for Mack. That means We can get rid of those silly config/thin.yml and config/thin.ru files. It also means we can make really easy use of all that the 'thin' command line executable has to offer.

When the next version of Thin comes out, there will be an update to Mack to support these changes.
