I know I've been talking about this release for a while now, and here it finally is. There's some good bug fixes in here, a few new rake tasks, and some other little things like that.

The biggest thing, however, is what's been causing a stir online now for the past few days, I've split out the ORM support into separate gems. I'm not going to go over it again, you can find all the details here:Â <a href="http://www.mackframework.com/2008/05/04/orms-and-mack/" target="_blank">http://www.mackframework.com/2008/05/04/orms-and-mack/</a>

Needless to say this is a good release to get, if not for the bug fixes alone, but for the great db:create rake tasks that are now in there. Thanks, again, to Darsono Sutedja for his great contributions.
