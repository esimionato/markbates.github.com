This release contains protection of already defined methods, such as <code>object_id</code>. This comes from Configatron advocate, Don March. Thanks Don!

Also in this release is a much improved <code>inspect</code> method.

<script src="http://gist.github.com/14603.js"></script>

As you can see the results of the inspect are a nice, alphabetized, 'cut and paste-able', print out of your configuration settings.

As always, it may take sometime for the gem mirrors to get the release. If you want it now you can install it using www.mackgems.com as the source:

<code>$ sudo gem install configatron --source=http://www.mackgems.com</code>


Look for Configatron support in the next release of Mack, 0.8.0, due out on Monday!
