So after my post about dropping ActiveRecord for DataMapper, I've received some very interesting feedback, mostly good, which is great. The best comment I received was from Sam Smoot, lead developer of DataMapper. Sam offered to give me commit access to the DataMapper repos on GitHub.

I took Sam up on his offer and I've already made several contributions. This is GREAT news for the Mack Framework. When the best technologies start working in concert, only good things can happen.

I'm really excited about what's happening with DataMapper 0.9.0, and I know it's only going to make Mack a better framework. I've already started working on upgrading Mack to use, the yet unreleased, DataMapper 0.9.0 code base.

I'll keep you all posted.
