Please allow for mirror prorogation.Â  Thanks to <a href="http://maraby.org/post/27611841" target="_blank">Matt Todd</a> for finding the first official Mack bug! Strangely enough, I actually welcome people finding bugs in Mack. It only serves to make it a better framework.

If you find a bug, please head on over to <a href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=4405" target="_blank">RubyForge</a> and submit a ticket for it, and I'll do my best to turn it around as quick as possible.
