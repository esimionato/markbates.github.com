Today two patches to Mack have been released, 0.7.0.1 and 0.6.1.2. They upgrade the version of application_configuration and are highly recommended. There was a bug with application_configuration that could cause it to stop loading configuration settings, which obviously, would be bad. :) Please update your version of Mack accordingly.&nbsp;

As a side note, Mack will be moving away from application_configuration to configatron around version 0.8.0, but more on that later.
