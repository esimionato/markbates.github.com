Thanks to Matthew A. Brown for his contribution to the Configatron library. He added the ability to 'lock'  down a namespace. Configatron has had a <code>protect</code> method for a while, but that only locks down a specific configuration. With <code>lock</code> you can lock down the whole namespace and prevent everything in that namespace from being altered. Maybe some code will help you understand:

When you get a chance checkout Mat's Github page, <a href="http://github.com/outoftime">http://github.com/outoftime</a>. Thank you very much Mat for your contribution.
