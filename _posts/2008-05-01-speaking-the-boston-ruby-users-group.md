I've mentioned this before, but now the details are finally in. I'll be speaking at the Boston Ruby Users Group on May 13th.

Here are the details:
Sermo
215 First Ave.
Cambridge, MA

The show starts at 7pm.

Also speaking that night are:

* Daniel Higginbotham will be presenting a tool he developed,Â Palmist, that is used to optimize MySQL databases on Rails sites.Â 

* Jonathan Barket will be presenting restful-authorization, anÂ authorization and workflow mechanism built on top ofÂ restful_authenticationÂ 

If you're in the neighborhood, and enjoy being a bit of a nerd, come on down.
