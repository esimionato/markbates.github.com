Now that I'm back on track with DataMapper, I've got migration support for both it and ActiveRecord just about done. In addition to the actual rake task, db:migrate (btw), I had to set up a good way to test rake tasks, something I'll share at a later date, but needless to say it's included with Mack. I also had to deal with the pain in the ass-ness of dealing with two VERY different ORMs, in the same test system! Let me tell you, that sucked!

Good news is that things seem to be working, at least going in the 'up' direction anyway. I still need to write the 'down' direction revert stuff. Hopefully, that shouldn't take too long now that I have a good way of testing the task and the migration stuff.

Unfortunately, I feel as though as soon as I release this stuff, which should be by the end of this weekend, DataMapper 0.9.0 will be out, and I'll have to re-write most of the DataMapper stuff because the API is changing so radically. I guess I'll just have to deal with that when the time comes.

In the meantime I'll let y'all know when migrations are done and out there in the wild.
