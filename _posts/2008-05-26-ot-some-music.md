So I know this is off topic, but hey, it's my blog, I'll do what I want. My new band, <a href="http://www.thebluewires.com" target="_blank">The Blue Wires</a>, has finally released it's first demos. We're pretty excited about them. If you have a moment, why not hop on over there and check them out, I think you'll enjoy!
