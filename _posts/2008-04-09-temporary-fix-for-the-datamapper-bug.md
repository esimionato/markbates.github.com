If like me you're plagued by this DataMapper bug that kills your test cases. I've packaged up a temporary version of the DataMapper gem that seems to fix the problem.

WARNING: This gem is NOT sanctioned by the DataMapper team. Use at your own risk.

If you use this gem and find any issues, please let me know. Also, if you use this gem and things seem to be working just fine, then please let me know that too. Good luck!
