Well, um... the title of the post really says it all. Mack is briefly discussed about 3/4 of the way in.

Here's the podcast: <a href="http://railsenvy.com/assets/2008/3/12/Podcast_22.mp3" target="_blank">http://railsenvy.com/assets/2008/3/12/Podcast_22.mp3</a>

Make sure to checkout their other podcasts, <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com" target="_blank">RailsEnvy.com</a> Those guys do a great job, and their quite funny to listen to as well.
