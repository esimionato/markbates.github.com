Well folks, RailsConf '08, is just about upon us. I'm heading out to Portland, are you? If so, let's make contact. It'll be great to meet everyone who's been following Mack and supporting what we're doing here.

I'm going to be leading a Birds of a Feather session Thursday night, "Rails Alternatives and You" from 7.30pm - 8.30pm in room D133. There are going to representatives of Merb and DataMapper there as well, so it should be a good time. Again, it'd be great to meet some of you.

On Friday during lunch at 12.35pm, I'll be signing copies of the 'Advanced Rails Recipes' book at the Powell's Book booth, along with some of the other authors. I think I'm more excited about this than anything else happening at the rest of the conference!

For those of you who have been to a RailsConf in the past, know it's a great time. For those who haven't, it's a great time. :) Last year I got to meet a lot of great people, and this year I'm looking forward to meeting more. I hope you'll be one of them.

See ya in Portland.
