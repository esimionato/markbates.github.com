Hey everyone, people have asked for it, so here it is, a Wiki for Mack:

<a href="http://wiki.mackframework.com/" target="_blank">http://wiki.mackframework.com/</a>

I've placed a few tutorials up there, and it'll be the defacto place for such information.

I highly encourage everyone to create an account and add to the knowledge base there.

On a different note, it looks like the next version of DataMapper will be out in the next few days. This is great news for Mack developers as the next release of Mack has been held back because it requires stuff in the DataMapper 0.9.2. Once that's out, the next version of Mack will be right on it's tail! Keep watching this space.
