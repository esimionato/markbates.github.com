Mack is a Ruby web application framework that is being built from the ground up to aid in the development of distributed, portal-like applications that have a need for speed. Mack supports best of breed technologies in a modular way.
<ul>
	<li>ORM Agnostic - Use DataMapper, ActiveRecord, Sequel, or "roll your own"! There are already gems to support DataMapper and ActiveRecord, more are on their way.</li>
	<li>Templating language agnostic. Support for ERB (Erubis), Xml::Builder, and Markaby are there and ready to go. But it's easy to add your own.</li>
</ul>
